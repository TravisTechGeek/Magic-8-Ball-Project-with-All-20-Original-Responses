# The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

# Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.
# We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:
  # Yes - definitely
  # It is decidedly so
  # Without a doubt
  # Reply hazy, try again
  # Ask again later
  # Better not tell you now
  # My sources say no
  # Outlook not so good
  # Very doubtful

# The output of the program will have the following format:
    # [Name] asks: [Question]
    # Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]
# For example:
    # Joe asks: Is this real life?
    # Magic 8-Ball's answer: Better not tell you now
import random # Import the random module to generate random numbers
name = ('Travis Paul Pyle') # name of the person who will be asking the Magic 8-Ball.
question = ('Will I have a career in coding development?') # question variable declared with a "yes" or "no" question, you'd like to ask the Magic 8-ball.
answer = ('') # answer variable declared assigned to an empty string so python knows the variable exists.
random_number = random.randint(1, 20) # variable created to store a randomly generated value
# print(random_number) # remove the comment to run the program several times to be sure values are being generated as expected. Be sure to replace the '#' when finsihed.
# Now that we’ve declared all the variables needed, it’s time to implement the core logic of our program!
# For this section, we’ll be utilizing control flow using an if/elif/else statement to assign different answers for each randomly generated value which we have shown above labeled 1-9.
